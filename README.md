# AI-Enhanced Bioinformatics - MUNI Summer School 2026

A four-week online prep course followed by a one-week in-person course on agentic development for bioinformaticians and life-science students. The prep teaches enough about LLMs, agentic IDEs, bio foundation models, and the agent–tool ecosystem that students arrive in Brno ready to *build*, not to be lectured at.

Hosted by Masaryk University. Course page: <https://summeratmasaryk.cz/aienhanced-bioinformatics-educ>

## Course philosophy

Three principles run through every week:

1. **Build alongside the agent, not under it.** Every exercise produces a real artifact - a script, a notebook, a small repo - that ends up in version control. Nothing is throwaway.
2. **Biological invariants are the cheapest validator you have.** Agents will produce code that runs, prints plausible output, and is silently wrong. The single most transferable skill in the course is the habit of running domain-aware checks on agent-generated artifacts. This thread is explicit from week 2 onward.
3. **Lessons accumulate.** Across all four weeks, you keep one [`lessons.md`](lessons.md) in your repo with two kinds of entry each week: **From the materials** (short video/paper notes and reflection exercises) and **Surprises** (concrete LLM and agent moments - tool, prompt, outcome). By week 4 this file is the most valuable artifact of the prep period.

## The running project

Across the four weeks, you build one cohesive deliverable: an agentic pipeline that touches real bioinformatics tools and a real bio foundation model, lives in a Git repo, and is reproducible by someone else. Each week adds a layer:

- **Week 1.** First chatbot interactions, GitHub and Slack accounts, this repo forked or cloned, `lessons.md` started.
- **Week 2.** Agent-generated bioinformatics code in the repo, with versioned commits and real tests against the trap exercise.
- **Week 3.** Foundation-model evaluation added - a genomic LM benchmarked against the published baseline on Genomic Benchmarks.
- **Week 4.** Reproducibility scaffolding (`pyproject.toml`, `AGENTS.md`), MCP demo, tagged release. Ready to bring to the in-person week.

Day one of the in-person week, you'll bring this repo plus `lessons.md` plus a list of three things you want to build.

## Tools and platforms

- **IDE:** [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google) (free for individuals and students). You can use [Cursor](https://cursor.com) and/or [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) if you are experienced with them.
- **Notebooks:** [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for compute-heavy exercises (free tier sufficient for everything in the course).
- **Version control and storage:** [GitHub](https://github.com). Everything ends up there.
- **Cohort chat:** *Slack*. Create an account in week 1 (see email); day-to-day questions, links, and logistics go there (workspace invite in the kick-off email).
- **Compute constraints assumed:** Colab free tier (T4 when available, CPU otherwise). All exercises sized to fit.

## How to engage with the videos and papers

Watching is not learning. For each video, stop every ~20 minutes and add a line under that week's **From the materials** section in [`lessons.md`](lessons.md): *"what's the one thing I'd want to test from what I just heard?"* For each paper, the same: *"what claim would I most want to verify on my own data?"*

LLM and agent surprises go under **Surprises** in the same file - with enough detail to be useful later (tool, prompt, what came back).

A short ungraded Google Form quiz per week (~5 application-style questions, answers revealed afterward) gives a soft accountability signal without creating evaluation overhead. Quizzes are open-everything; questions are designed so an LLM alone can't answer them - they require integration with your own context.

## Assessment

Three things, that's it:

1. A working repo (this one, forked or cloned) with weekly commits.
2. [`lessons.md`](lessons.md) - both subsections each week filled in as you go (**From the materials** + **Surprises**).
3. A one-paragraph reflection at the end of week 4: *"What would I trust an agent to do in my research, and what would I not?"*

Anyone who can answer that reflection concretely after four weeks has gotten what the prep was meant to deliver.

## In-person week (22–26 June 2026, Brno)

The in-person week shapes the prep. **Day one in person: pair up, exchange repos, and try to reproduce each other's week 3 results.** That single arrangement raises the quality of every week 4 deliverable, so plan for it.

The `exercises/` directory contains small starter assets for the hands-on weeks. Students add their own scripts, notebooks, results, and mini-project files as they go.
