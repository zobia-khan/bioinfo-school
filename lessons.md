# lessons.md — your prep log

One file for the whole prep. Keep two kinds of entry in **separate subsections each week** — don't mix them in one paragraph.

| Subsection | What goes here | How much detail |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **From the materials** | Notes while watching or reading; answers to each week's reflection exercises | Usually one sentence per video chunk or paper section; reflection exercises can be a short paragraph each |
| **Surprises** | Moments an LLM or agent surprised you — good or bad — in chat or in the IDE | Concrete: tool/model, what you asked, what came back, optional takeaway |

Commit and push weekly. By week 4 this file is one of the most useful artifacts you bring to Brno. (`reflection.md` in week 4 is separate — one final paragraph for assessment.)

## From the materials — what to write

While watching or reading, stop every ~20 minutes (or after each major section) and add a line answering:

- *Video:* **What's the one thing I'd want to test from what I just heard?**
- *Paper:* **What claim would I most want to verify on my own data?**

Each week may also assign a **reflection exercise** (structured thinking using the week's mental model). Put those answers here too — they are not required to be personal chat logs.

## Surprises — what to write

Add an entry whenever an LLM or agent catches you off guard. Include enough detail that you (or a classmate) could understand the moment months later.

- **When** — approximate date
- **Tool / model** — e.g. ChatGPT (free), Claude, Antigravity agent, Cursor, …
- **What you asked** — paste or paraphrase the prompt; name any file or data involved
- **What happened** — the surprising part
- **Takeaway** (optional) — one line on what you'd do differently

**Bad (too vague):** *"ChatGPT hallucinated something."*

**Good:**

> **2026-05-26 · ChatGPT (free, no browsing)** — Asked: *"What is the Ensembl ID for human BRCA1?"* Answered confidently with `ENSG00000012048` — correct — then cited a made-up paper (*Smith et al., Nature 2019*) and a DOI that 404s. **Takeaway:** right gene, invented provenance; never trust citations without checking.

> **2026-06-03 · Antigravity agent** — Asked it to filter a BED file to chr21. Code ran, printed 1,842 lines, looked plausible. Checked: 0-based coordinates on a file the header said was 1-based. **Takeaway:** spot-check coordinate conventions before trusting counts.
